Microservices – Brief Summary

Microservices are an architectural approach for building applications as a set of small, independent, and loosely coupled services. Each microservice is responsible for a specific functionality of the system and can be developed, deployed,
and maintained independently without affecting the entire application.In a monolithic architecture, all functionalities of an application are packaged into a single unit and usually share a single database. Any change or failure may require 
redeploying the whole system.In contrast, microservices architecture decomposes the application into multiple services, where each service can run independently, often with its own database, improving flexibility and fault isolation.
The benefits of microservices architecture include:
1.Low coupling, allowing services to evolve independently.
2.High scalability, as each service can be scaled separately based on demand.
3.Fault isolation, meaning a failure in one service does not stop the entire application.
Microservices communicate using different methods, including HTTP-based communication (REST APIs), message-based communication (such as queues), and event-oriented communication, 
enabling efficient and flexible interaction between services in a distributed system.
